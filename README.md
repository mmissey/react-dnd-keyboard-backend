## React-DnD-Keyboard-Backend
This is a backend for use with react-dnd. It listens for enter on drag targets and focus/enter on drop targets. You'll probably want to use this with react-dnd-multi-backend to have it transition between backends based on input.
## Installation

If you use [npm](http://npmjs.com):

```
npm install --save react-dnd-html5-backend
```
